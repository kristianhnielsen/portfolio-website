## Description

YouTube downloader with a GUI. Due to the unstable VPN connections, YouTube in China is unreliable at best. I was relying heavily on Youtube videos to learn about programming. This allowed me to download videos, full tutorial playlists, even a whole channelâ€™s video collection so I could watch and re-watch videos whenever _I_ wanted.

This was my first attempt at making something with an interface, and I realized how important it was for me to be able to use my skills to make something that other people could use. This was the project that set me on my path to web development.

I also learned how to export the project into an install file, which allowed me to share my solution with others.
