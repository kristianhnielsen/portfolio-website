## Description

Webscraper used to get gather and distribute news articles based on keywords.

This project allows for a list of “collections” based on any number of keywords. The articles are organized in an MS Word document with custom styling, allowing for easy overview. The documents are then sent out via e-mail.

This was a project born from automatetheboringstuffwith python, which then got expanded way beyond it’s initial scope.

The problem is solved was, skimming news websites and articles, copying and pasting text, and e-mailing for proofreading, was all done manually on a daily basis.

This was my very first project that had a real impact, was solving a real problem.

This project taught me the basics of refactoring, organizing code, Object-Oriented Programming, and scope creep.

I also learned how dynamic the web actually is under the hood, by how many times a correction was necessary when a path or selector had changed for a target HTML element.
