## Description

This portfolio website showcases higlighted projects, a blog I occasionally write for, and descriptions of me and the coding milestones I have crossed.

Using Astro, Tailwind, and Typescript, I've done my best to make the project as easy to maintain as possible without compromising accessibility, well-knowing that I'll have to update the website many times in it's lifetime.

That being said, as it is a portfolio, I've allowed myself to focus less on performance and reducing Javascript in the hopes of making something that leaves a deeper impression.
