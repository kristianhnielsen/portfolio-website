## Description

A web app built as a learning project to get a better understanding of SQL, databases, authentication, as well as the newer versions of Next.

By using open-source dictionary data, I built out the dictionary as a starting point. I chose Supabase as my database, as it also provides authentication, and has excellent documentation and guides for setup.

I anticipated that I'd have a lot of issues formatting and displaying the simplified and traditional Chinese characters correctly; that it would be hard to create the database; and that authentication would be a beast to tackle.
Not that I _didn't_ struggle with these topics, but to my surprise, learning and understanding Next and React Server Components was, by far, my largest hurdle when building this project.
The more recent versions of Next have gotten a fair bit of criticism, and I now see why.

This app started out as a mere learning project, but has grown to be a bit of a passion project which I will probably add more functionality in time, as the app offers functionality that I want to use myself.

Fun fact, the name "Easy Dictionary" comes from the Chinese，<a href="https://easy-dictionary.com/dictionary/易字">易字</a> [yi4 zi4], means "easy character" and is phonetically very similar to the English word "easy".
