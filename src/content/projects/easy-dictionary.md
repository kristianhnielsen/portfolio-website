## Description

A web app built as a learning project to get a better understanding of SQL, databases, authentication, as well as the newer versions of Next.

By using open-source dictionary data, I built out the dictionary as a starting point. I chose Supabase as my database, as it also provides authentication, and has excellent documentation and guides for setup.

During development I learned a lot more about React Server Components, database models and designing a database, authentication, as well as formatting and displaying the simplified and traditional Chinese characters.

This app started out as a mere learning project, but has grown to be a bit of a passion project which I will probably add more functionality in time, as the app has functionality that I want to use myself.

Fun fact, the name "Easy Dictionary" comes from the Chinese，<a href="https://easy-dictionary.com/dictionary/易字">易字</a> [yi4 zi4], means "easy character" and is phonetically very similar to the English word "easy".
