## Description

A website with accessibility and multiple languages, developed for the purpose of attracting clients in need of web development services.

The website is available in English, Danish, and Chinese.

I added a blog in hopes of practicing my writing skills, getting a more in-depth knowledge of Astro in the process, and got to explore the, at the time, newly released Content Collections.

This website was previously host at <a href="https://kristiannielsen.com">kristiannielsen.com</a>.
